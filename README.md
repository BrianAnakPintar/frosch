The idea of this project is to make easy presentations using just markdown.
So basically you as the user can just focus on writing the content of the presentation,
rather than the design of it.

### Why the name frosch?
I google translated the word frog into german. Yes like [Frieren names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Frieren_characters#:~:text=The%20character%20names%20are%20all%20German%20words).  
Why frogs? Honestly I have no clue, it sounds cool though. "Hopping through slides"
